Piped logging, a la Apache.  Since we now ship mod_exec, it seems only fair
to ship a logging module which forks/execs external logging processes.
Hopefully this will make replication mechanisms easier for those attempting to
implement such things via FIFO logging, as well as support better log
rotation (e.g. via rotatelogs or cronolog or whatever).

Configuration

  PipedLog logFormatName /path/to/command command-opts

Implementation

  May need to add a log_name field to the pr_log_event_t struct
  (in include/log.h), so that we know the name of the log, e.g. for
  ExtendedLog LogFormat names.  The mod_log_pipe module can use a table
  to record LogFormat names to command pipes (popen(3)?).

  Other than that, having log listeners for PR_LOG_TYPE_EXTLOG events
  should suffice.

Questions

  What about for TransferLog, SystemLog, TraceLog (e.g. for rotation)?
